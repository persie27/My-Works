# Machine Learning Project: Identifying Money Laundering

This project focuses on using classification algorithms to identify money laundering activities. Key components of the project include:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the structure and patterns in the dataset related to money transactions and potential laundering activities.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for model training, which involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the predictive performance of the models.

- **Model Training**: Implementing various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc., to predict whether a transaction is likely to involve money laundering.

- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves to ensure they effectively distinguish between normal and suspicious transactions.

This project aims to contribute to the field of financial crime detection by leveraging machine learning techniques to combat money laundering effectively.
